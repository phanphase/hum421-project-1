MY self critique.

Throughout this project, I intentionally pushed myself outside of my comfort zone by exploring new CSS techniques 
such as implementing a fixed-position navigation bar, using hover effects, and making stylistic choices that I may 
not have considered in the past.

If I had more time to refine this project, I would focus on creating a more cohesive and visually unified theme. 
While I’m generally satisfied with my chosen color scheme, the overall design of the site doesn’t yet feel fully 
polished or complete.

Additionally, I wish I had been able to present the HTML content in a more structured and readable format. Rather 
than adapting the information into a more web-friendly layout, I largely replicated the structure of the provided 
Google Doc. As a result, the page reads more like a block of text than a dynamic, engaging resource.
