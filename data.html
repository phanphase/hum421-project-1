				This short lesson is intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students undertaking original
				research projects. After completing the 30-minute lesson, you will be able to to:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Format raw research data in an Excel spreadsheet for efficient analysis</li>
				<li>Run basic descriptive statistics in Excel</li>
				<li>Prepare the document for statistical analysis in the software package PASW</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Format data for analysis</h2>
			<p>
				<a>
					Make sure the computer you are working on has Microsoft Excel installed. Open the document
					ToolBox_DataLesson.xls [[[NOTE: NEED LINK TO DOWNLOAD TUTORIAL EXCEL FILE]]] in Excel and follow
					along with the lesson, taking action as instructed.
				</a>
				<br />
				<a
					>In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variable has been entered in the first row of each
					column.</a
				>
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Each variable name must be different from other variable names.</li>
				<li>The first variable (in column A) is a <span class="blue">unique identifier</span>.</li>
				<li>
					Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special characters), so change
					4tutorial_types to tutorial_types.
				</li>
				<li>
					Name variables so that they are intuitive to you. Therefore, change use and useful to
					perc_ease_of_use and perc_usefulness, respectively.
				</li>
				<li>
					Your spreadsheet should look like Figure 1, and it should now be readily apparent that Column F
					refers to Perceived Usefulness and Column G refers to Perceived Ease of Use.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<img src="illustrations/datalesson_fig3.png" />
			<h4>
				Tutorial type, gender, experience, and task categorical values have been formatted as dichotomous
				variables.
			</h4>

			<p>Data values, or rows, have been input for each subject in the experiment.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Decide on input conventions and stick to them. In gender, change the "female" value to "F".</li>
				<li>
					Separate data into component values whenever possible by adding new columns. For example,
					tasks_completed values (Y/Y/N) can be broken up into three components. So, add columns task1, task2,
					and task3, and reformat values appropriately.
				</li>
				<li>
					Double-check to ensure no data entry errors have been made, then delete the old tasks_completed
					column.
				</li>
				<li>Your Raw_Dataset spreadsheet should now look like Figure 2.</li>
			</ol>
			<img src="illustrations/datalesson_fig2.png" />
			<h4>Values for each variable are entered in a consistent format.</h4>

			<p>
				Replace categorical data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) to indicate whether or not the value is
				represented for the given subject/item. This makes the categorical values
				<span class="blue"> dichotomous</span>, which gives the researcher maximum flexibility in testing for
				relationships or correlations.
			</p>

			<aside>
				<h4>
					Dichotomous variables allow for the easy isolation of characteristics for analysis. For example,
					separating experience levels allows the researcher to test in PASW whether subjects with low
					experience have perceived ease of use scores significantly different from those with medium and high
					experience levels.
				</h4>
			</aside>

			<ol>
				<li>Copy the Raw_Dataset values into the Sheet1 tab. Rename this sheet Raw_Dataset.</li>
				<li>
					In the Formatted_Data sheet, add new columns with Insert > Columns for each distinct value in
					categorical data columns (tutorial_types, gender, exp_level, task1, task2, and task3). You do not
					have to add a new column for task1, task2, and task3 because their values are already dichotomous.
				</li>
				<li>
					Rename columns according to each possible categorical value. Copy and paste the values from the
					original column.
				</li>
				<li>
					Replace dichotomous data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) using the replace function: Edit >
					Replace.
				</li>
				<li>Your Formatted_Data spreadsheet should now look like Figure 3.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>
				Tutorial type, gender, experience, and task categorical values have been formatted as dichotomous
				variables.
			</h3>

			<hr />
			<h2>Run descriptive statistics</h2>

			<aside>
				<h4>
					Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions. For example, perc_enjoy is much
					higher on average than perc_usefulness, which also has a large variance. This suggests that a
					segment of users may not have considered the system useful even though they enjoyed using it.
				</h4>
			</aside>
			<p>
				<a>
					Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results in a new spreadsheet. If
					necessary, rearrange columns so that data requiring summary, those with continuous values, are
					adjacent. (In the spreadsheet, the continuous values of <i>perc_enjoy, perc_usefulness</i>, and
					perc_ease_of_use are already adjacent.)
				</a>
				<br />
				<a>
					Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data requiring summary, making sure not to include
					variable labels.
				</a>
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Go to <span class="bold">Tools > Add-Ins...</span> and make sure
					<span class="bold">Analysis ToolPak</span> is checked. Click OK.
				</li>
				<li>
					Go to <span class="bold">Tools > Data Analysis</span> and select
					<span class="bold">Descriptive Statistics</span>. Click OK.
				</li>
				<li>
					Enter the input range in the blank and check <span class="bold">Summary Statistics</span>. Click OK.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				<a>
					The descriptive statistics summary will output in a new sheet. Rename this spreadsheet
					Descriptive_Stats. Label the output according to the variables. For example, Column 1 should be
					perc_enjoy. Your Descriptive_Stats spreadsheet should now look like Figure 4.
				</a>
				<br />
				<a>
					Analyzing descriptive statistics is a great way to start appraising a dataset before running
					inferential statistics. What insights about the dataset can you glean from the summary statistics
					for <i>perc_usefulness and perc_ease_of_use</i>?
				</a>
			</p>
			<img src="illustrations/datalesson_fig4.png" />
			<p></p>
			<h4>
				Excel will not run descriptive statistics with non-numeric characters, so the variable labels must be
				re-entered.
			</h4>

			<hr />
			<h2>Run inferential statistics</h2>
			<p>
				Open PASW and upload the spreadsheet. (IIT labs in Stuart Building, room 112, have PASW. You can also
				download a 30-day free trial.)
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					When PASW starts, it will prompt you for a data source. Select
					<span class="bold">Open an existing data source > More Files...</span>
				</li>
				<li>Set the file type to Excel, then find and open the file.</li>
				<li>From the list, select the Formatted_Data worksheet. Click OK. You should now see the dataset.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				The most commonly used statistical methods and tests are found under the Analyze menu in the standard
				toolbar.
			</p>
			<p>
				Figure 5 shows where to find some common statistical methods and tests. Under PASW's
				<span class="bold">Analyze</span>
				menu, see if you can also find the following:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test</li>
				<li>Simple linear regression</li>
				<li>Non-parametric correlation</li>
			</ol>
			<img src="illustrations/datalesson_fig5.png" />
			<h4>
				Don't assume PASW doesn't run a given test. Many are located under broader statistical classifications.
			</h4>

			<p>
				Use your prior knowledge or the
				<a href="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/default.htm"> Choosing the Correct Statistic</a>
				resource to determine which statistic to run to find whether there is a significant difference in
				<i>perc_usefulness</i> between <i>free_play</i> and other tutorial types.
			</p>
			<aside>
				<h4>
					Consult
					<a href="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/default.htm"
						>UCLA's Choosing the Correct Statistic</a
					>
					to ensure the statistical anlaysis is appropriate for your research question(s), variables of
					interest, and associated data types.
				</h4>
			</aside>
			<p>
				You should have determined that the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance is the appropriate test.
				Go to <span class="bold">Analyze > Nonparametric Tests > K Independent Samples...</span> A new window
				will open prompting you to select the variables (by column name) to be tested.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Select the <i>perc_usefulness</i> variable from the scrollable list on the left, and click the top
					arrow to move it to the Test Variable List (i.e. dependent variable).
				</li>
				<li>
					Select the <i>free_play</i> variable from the scrollable list, and click the bottom arrow to move it
					to the Grouping Variable section (i.e. independent variable).
				</li>
				<li>
					Click <span class="bold">Define Range...</span>, and enter "0" in the Minimum field and "1" in the
					Maximum field. This specifies the two categorical variables to be tested. Your screen should now
					look like Figure 6. Click Continue.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<img src="illustrations/datalesson_fig6.png" />

			<p></p>
			<h4>
				For Kruskal-Wallis, an independent (free_play) and a dependent variable (perc_usefulness) are selected.
			</h4>
			<p>
				Click OK to display the statistical analysis results to new viewing window. Your results screen should
				look like Figure 7. Because statistical analysis output contains many numerical components (some of
				which must be cited in formal reports), it is a good idea to save it to a format independent of the PASW
				software. To save the results, go to File > Export. Change Document Type to the desired output format
				(Word, Excel, PDF, etc.), then click OK.
			</p>

			<img src="illustrations/datalesson_fig7.png" />
			<p></p>
			<h4>PASW allows users to export statistics to common document types.</h4>

			<h3>Test your knowledge</h3>
			<p>
				Now that you've finished the lesson, please complete a short quiz to test your understanding of
				formatting research datasets for comprehensive statistical analysis.
